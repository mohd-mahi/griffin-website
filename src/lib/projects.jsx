              The 4-Lane NH-29 Bypass Phase-II is a crucial segment of the
              Varanasi Ring Road, designed to alleviate urban traffic congestion
              by providing a bypass for heavy vehicles. Spanning 27.27 km, this
              phase connects Sandaha Village on NH-29 to Revasa Village on NH-2,
              facilitating smoother transit and reducing travel time. The
              project includes the construction of interchanges, bridges, and
              service roads, ensuring efficient connectivity and improved
              traffic flow.
